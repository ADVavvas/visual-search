# visual-search

A simple visual search system in Matlab for the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition module (Year 3). 

Includes parts of the SIFT detector &amp; descriptor algorithm.

In its current state the SIFT detector is incomplete and often does not work as expected.

Parts of the code (e.g. writting the descriptors to files and loading the files in cvpr_visualsearch.m) are missing as they have not been written by me.
